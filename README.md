CAAP-CS team projects: Alex, Andrea, Kevin

## Alex Bisnath:alex.bisnath@gmail.com  
* Alex worked on the main algorithm. He made the hash table, filled the hash table, filtered the table for short anagrams, and wrote a function to filter the table for anagram pairs that were numerically intersting. 
## Kevin Song:ksong814@uchicago.edu
* Kevin worked on the functions for suprising results. He coded two functions: one where the first letter of an anagram was shared by another anagram as its last letter and the other where a certain letter recurred often as the first letter of several anagrams. 
## Andrea Domiter:andreakdomiter@gmail.com
* Andrea worked on creating the Powerpoint and writing the readme file. She created a function to find palindromes, but found that it did not return anything because there were no palindromes for words greater than 8 letters. 

## Instructions
* Uncomment the various methods in the main function to see the various lists of anagrams. The comments inside of main delineate which function calls do what.
